# Awesome DDoS Papers
A curated list of DDoS papers, articles, tutorials and howtos. 

## Notes
The purpose of this list is to provide a starting point for understanding the state of the art in DDoS attack detection and mitigation. I started this list to keep track of the papers I read on these topics during my thesis on DDoS attack detection. I try to organize the list according to the main topics which are detection, mitigation and evolution of DDoS attacks. But also to group the papers in these sub-categories within these three categories previously stated. If you want to add a paper or an article that you think is relevant to the topic of this list, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
