# Awesome DDoS Papers
A curated list of DDoS papers, articles, tutorials and howtos. 

## Notes
The purpose of this list is to provide a starting point for understanding the state of the art in DDoS attack detection and mitigation. I started this list to keep track of the papers I read on these topics during my thesis on DDoS attack detection. I try to organize the list according to the main topics which are detection, mitigation and evolution of DDoS attacks. But also to group the papers in these sub-categories within these three categories previously stated. If you want to add a paper or an article that you think is relevant to the topic of this list, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

* [A DDoS attack detection mechanism based on protocol specific traffic features](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2393216.2393249) - Finding out the proper subset of features which can be used for DDoS detection.
* [Jaqen: A High-Performance Switch-Native Approach for Detecting and Mitigating Volumetric DDoS Attacks with Programmable Switches](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/liu-zaoxing) - A switch-native approach for volumetric DDoS defense that can run detection and mitigation functions entirely inline on switches, without relying on additional data plane hardware.
* [Classiﬁcation of UDP Trafﬁc for DDoS Detection](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/leet12/leet12-final25.pdf) - This paper presents a proportional-packet rate, and the use of this criterion to classify UDP traffic with the goal of detecting malicious addresses that launch flooding-based UDP DDoS attacks. 
* [DDoS attack prevention using collaborative approach for cloud computing](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-019-02994-2) - Represent a comparative analysis of different DDoS attack tools as well as a third party auditor (TPA) based packet traceback approach.
* [Jaqen: A High-Performance Switch-Native Approach for Detecting and Mitigating Volumetric DDoS Attacks with Programmable Switches](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/liu-zaoxing) - A switch-native approach for volumetric DDoS defense that can run detection and mitigation functions entirely inline on switches, without relying on additional data plane hardware.
* [DDoS attacks in cloud computing: Issues, taxonomy, and future directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.08187.pdf) - This paper, present developments related to DDoS attack mitigation solutions in the cloud
* [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-6031-2_34](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-6031-2_34) - Presents strenghs and limitations of DDoS detection mechanisms paradigms.
